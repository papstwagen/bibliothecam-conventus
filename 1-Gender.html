        <blockquote>

            <h1>On the Expression of Transgender Thought</h1>
            <p>Thus far in the folds of Western Civilisation, the ideals of a progressive liberal democracy consistently run parallel with the unabated championing of individualism and the four freedoms. The freedom of speech and expression,</p>
            <p> It is in the zealous gratification of this freedom that modern Transgender thought has emerged. It is undeniably so within the progressive school of thought that following the achievement of equal rights for men and women and the repudiation of  societal (heteronormative) norms and taboos surrounding sexuality and its discussion, within Western societies — the abolition of the gender binary and gender stereotypes must follow suit. However, not only does Transgender thought fail to champion this abolition, it actively works to oppose it.</p>
            <p>Evaluating from a progressive standpoint, this paper aims not to propose a refutation of Transgender thought on the basis of morals and ethics, but rather a refutation of the perception of Transgender thought as a progressive ideology. For this purpose, Transgender thought must be deconstructed into two schools: psychosocial manifestations and physiological manifestations, and each thusly geometrically analysed. </p>
