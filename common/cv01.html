            <h1>On Transgender Thought</h1>
            <p>Thus far in the folds of Western Civilisation, the ideals of a progressive liberal democracy consistently run parallel with the unabated championing of individualism. Western societies from and henceforth the 18th century have been distinguished by the adoption of <i>laissez-faire</i> market economies, as well as the continuous expansion of civil and political rights. Arriving at the 21st century, the engine of Western progressivism has switched gears in the pursuit of one particular right — the freedom of expression. It is in the zealous gratification of this right that modern Transgender thought has emerged.</p>
            <p>Within the Western societies, it is undeniably so that, for the pursuit of <i>progress</i>, following the achievement of equal rights for men and women, as well as the repudiation of societal (heteronormative) norms and taboos surrounding sexuality and its discussion — the abolition of the gender binary and gender stereotypes seems fit to follow suit. However, and despite being clothed within the coat of progressivism, not only does Transgender thought fail to champion this abolition, it actively works to oppose it.</p>
            <p>Evaluating from a progressive standpoint, this paper aims not to propose a refutation of Transgender thought on the basis of morals and ethics, but rather to provide a thorough refutation of the perception of Transgender thought as a progressive ideology. For this purpose, Transgender thought must be wholly deconstructed into three general schools: psychosocial manifestations, cosmetic manifestations, and physiological manifestations, with each thusly geometrically analysed. </p>

            <p>The most prevalent justification for Transgender thought is the idea of a <i>gender identity,</i> and the subsequent secondary idea that an individual can be assigned an incorrect gender identity at birth. As such, an incontestable axiom has been established — that this first school of Transgender thought relies upon the existence of the social construct of gender, which is to be defined as the subjective (whether personally and/or societally) association of social and cultural distinctions with sex (most prevalently, male and female), and how individuals may be positioned within such an association.</p>
            <p>That is to say, Transgender thought bases itself upon a general mood. This sentence is purposefully vague. It emulates the statement given by the National Center for Transgender Equality, which reads: <i>"Gender identity is your internal knowledge of your gender."</i> As previously established, </p>
